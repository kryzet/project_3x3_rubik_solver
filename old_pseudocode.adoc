= Pseudocode: General overview of the program's work

- Define the Rubik's cube (exact method tentative, might use a compile-time constant)
- Fill the cube's arrays with the colors. Front is green, top is white, the cube should be filled in a solved state.
- Ask the user for a scramble such as one that you can get from https://cstimer.net
- Scramble the cube's array using the user's moves
- Implement (both?) Beginner's Method and CFOP for solving the cube (and ask the user which method they want to be used)
- Solve the cube using the method, logging every move.
- Print the log
